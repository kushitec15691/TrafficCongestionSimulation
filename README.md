# 🚗 Traffic Congestion Simulation & Complexity Analysis

![Traffic Animation](animation/traffic_animation.png)

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates traffic congestion using the **Nagel-Schreckenberg Cellular Automaton**—a simple yet powerful rule-based model for vehicle movement. The simulation captures how individual car behavior leads to **emergent traffic patterns** such as jams and stop-and-go waves.

Using Python, the simulation measures system complexity through:
- **Shannon entropy** of speed distributions
- **Gap sizes** between cars
- **Frequency of cars stuck in congestion**

An interactive animation visualizes traffic flow and jam formation in real time.
